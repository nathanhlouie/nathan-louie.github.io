# snaportals

I've always wanted a way to see whether my family or friends were busy typing away at their computer, or that I had a chance to talk to them. Especially since the pandemic, this issue has become more prevalent in my life. Thus, I made a distributed systems app that would periodically take status pictures of each person with the app, and share those pictures with the rest of their group in order to share one's real life status.

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/nathan-louie/snaportals).

# Features

The gallery view lets a user see the pictures taken from their friends on the app. The user can also see their own picture taken as the first picture in the gallery of pictures.

The camera view will take a picture of the user to distribute to the other connected users on the app.

The app switches between the gallery and camera view periodically every 10 minutes.

# Stack

- This project was created with Flutter
- Utilized the Google I/O Photobooth starter program
